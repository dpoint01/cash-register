Three Cash Register Programs (Ruby)


These three programs build on each other; cash1 is a first experimentation with ruby, cash2 brings in additonal functionality,
and cash3 is a rather complete version which supports CSV input/output.

These three programs were completed in collaboration with John Keith (fellow launcher).

Sample Command Line Ouput of Program: ( "$>" signifies input lines)
